# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create Notflix, a Netflix parody application where users can upload and browse their own fake films in a Netflix-inspired interface.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a dark-themed UI with Netflix-like visual design (black background, red accents, similar typography and layout)
- Implement film upload functionality accepting title, description, thumbnail image, and video file
- Create browsing interface with horizontal scrolling rows organized by categories
- Build video playback interface with standard controls (play, pause, seek, volume, fullscreen)
- Design Notflix branding and logo that parodies Netflix while maintaining distinct identity
- Store and serve all uploaded films and media through Internet Computer backend

**User-visible outcome:** Users can upload their own fake films with thumbnails and videos, then browse them in a Netflix-style interface with hero banner, horizontal scrolling categories, and watch them in a full-featured video player.
